# Dependancies
This VIVOE (Vetronics Infrastructure for Video Over Ethernet) environment is currently tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Please ensure you have the following packages installed prior to building the application:
```
sudo apt install libcairo2-dev libxt-dev libsdl2-dev doxygen libxml2-dev ncurses-dev libxext-dev libswscale-dev libprotobuf-dev libgeographic-dev cmake g++ libgtk-3-dev --no-install-recommends
```
# HMI
The project includes an reference implementation of the GVA (Generic Vehicle Architecture) like Human Machine Interface (HMI). This is meant as a designed for testing different live video sources and working with streaming protocols and does not implement functionality defined in the GVA Land Data Model (LDM). Its primerially used to demonstrate various video streaming pipelines and control mechanisms for real time video processing. Its primary purpose is for research and development and experimentation with different HMI elements for human factors and sensor integration, test, monitoring and detection of system wide events.

![GVA HMI](images/Display_RD104_02_sm.jpg#left)<br>

> NOTE: Not all labels are currently implemented, project in heavy development! See [DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md) for issues and features.

Video can be streamed to an optional video processing unit (GPU/TPU for AI/ML and hemeshperical video processing) before being recieved by the HMI processor for video overlays and personalisation for gunner/commaner and driver displays. Multicast vdeo streams should be recieved by all consumers in realtime (networking not shown). There may be one or more users and displays on any given manned vehicle.

![GVA Dataflow](images/GVA-DataFlow.PNG#left)

Touch screen inputs and bezel key inputs are sent back to the HMI to update the overlays in the RTP stream. The display can be 'dumb' with HMI / Video processing being done on a seperate LRU. RTP streams being recieved by the display have the overlays already rendered in the video stream.

### HMI Controls

To build the HMI clone the code and run cmake. Automated builds are handled by travis-ci.

The following keys can be used to interact with the display:
* \+ Rotate PPI clockwise
* \- Rotate PPI anti-clockwise
* \> Rotate Sight anti-clockwise
* < Rotate Sight anti-clockwise
* [1-8] Function SA,WPN...
* ESC Quit
* L Toggle labels
* A Alarms
* K Keyboard
  * CAPS-LOCK toggle upper case
  * NUM-LOCK toggle special chars

## DDS
Support for FastRTPS is being tested currently and provides RTPS communication as prescribed by the GVA standards. Messages are derived from IDL that is _not_ part of the LDM. There are two DDS protocols on Github that look like good candidates opensource projects implementing GVA.
* https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-RTPS
* https://github.com/ADLINK-IST/opensplice

I will be testing FastRTPS as this is the default choice for [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/).

## GPS source
Application supports locally connected NMEA (USB virtual serial) GPS source. The only tested device is currently the [GlobalSat BU-353-S4 USB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/GlobalSat-BU-353-S4-Receiver-SiRF-Black/dp/B008200LHW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=GlobalSat+BU-353-S4+USB&qid=1560375523&s=electronics&sr=1-1) available from Amazon and Robotshop. This outputs [NMEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) formatted strings as shown below. These are read, converted and displayed on the display in the status bar if present. This is done by the same thread that updates the clock on the HMI. If no device is present then a dummy location is used which will place you in London at a famous landmark.

```
Internally [libnema](https://github.com/ross-newman/nmealib) is used aquire [NMEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) messages from the GPS source. Once aquired conversion from decimal long/lat to degrees minutes seconds is required for the internal representation. Conversions to many other formats are possible using [libGeographic](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io), currently the only conversion implemented is [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System).

# ODB Source
For CAN messages can be read via the ELM 327 compatible USB dongle such as this one on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Weddecor-Interface-Diagnostic-Scanner-Adapter/dp/B0798LK2C2/ref=asc_df_B0798LK2C2/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310513207083&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13476710392809007404&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007089&hvtargid=pla-765104732771&psc=1). This is primerially used to drive the screen widgets on the DRV (Drivers) display. Currently no support for MilCAN hardware is planned, automotive CAN only.

# Offline Maps
If a valid GPS source is present then an offline map will be available rendered by [libosmscout](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Libosmscout). This feature is currently being developed. OpenStreetMap database is required plus some additional processing prior to use. An regularly updated collection of global maps can be downloaded from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). Entire world comes in at 77Gb before processing.

![GVA Dataflow](images/Screenshot-OSMScout-Map.png)<br>
**Example of the Battle Management System (BMS) screen**

You can render maps using servers provided by [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) using my [juypter notebook](https://gist.github.com/ross-newman/8634f69e98ac2aded46552e7b0768dbb) for processing the data and depositing the results on to a Google Drive account. 

Tutorial [documentation for libosmscout](http://libosmscout.sourceforge.net/tutorials/importing/) contains a full description on how to prepare the maps database.
